\abstract

A model for condensation of fermions in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background is presented. It is shown that condensation can happen, via the BCS mechanism due to a four-fermion interaction which appears naturally when fermions are included in gravity. We argue that this process can form the basis for a non-perturbative resolution to the cosmological constant problem. In order to make contact with observational evidence, we show that CMB data from the WMAP3 mission can be fitted to a cosmological model with zero $\Lambda_{eff}$, provided that we live in a universe riddled with voids of the order of ~100 Mpc. For our calculations voids are approximated by LTB metrics. We argue that the correct way to model voids is based on the methods of dark matter structure formation, which are highly non-linear but are amenable to an analytic treatment.

%% this is the end of the abstract

%% after the abstract come the table of contents, the list of tables,
%% and the list of figures
%% Note about the figure list... so the figure list is a decent length,
%% use the following command for the figure captions:
%% \caption[Short figure title to appear in figure list]{Normal figure caption}
%% (this trick unfortunately does not work with the deluxetable 
%% ``\tablecaption'' command, so be careful what you put in the table captions)
%%
%% If you have really long tables that cover multiple pages, you
%% will want to use the ``longtable'' environment (it is very similer to
%% deluxetable) but allows you to specify headers and footers for the first,
%% last, and middle pages of the figure.

%% use this command to omit the list of tables,
%% if the thesis doesn't contain any tables
%\nolotables

\acknowledgments  % optional

This work was made possible by all the people who had faith in me when I doubted myself, who lifted me when I was down and who inspired me when I felt lost. They include:

George Peter - a teacher extraordinaire, a kind and inspiring man who not only provided moral ballast at a crucial time in my life but also encouraged me to stick to my chosen path;

my high school math teacher - another great educator who recognized the stifling effect schools can have on a young individuals creativity and ambition and therefore nurtured the same in me;

Narendra Srivastava - an artist, a genius and a man of great wisdom with whom I shared many evenings playing chess and talking about physics, philosophy and life;

Shubranghsu Sengupta (Rushi) - my friend and confidante who first introduced me to the wonderful world of physics;

Sat Pal Kalra - for feeding a youngster's zeal for knowledge and inspiration with subscriptions to Scientific American and books such as \emph{A Brief History of Time};

Stephon Alexander - a brilliant physicist, my advisor and guiding light as a graduate student;

Martin Bojowald - another physicist \emph{par excellence} whose decision to serve as my committee chair was a life-saver;

the State College "gang" consisting of Vinay Kumar, Lisa Santini, Megan Broda, Whitney Polakowski, Renae DiPierre, Nathaniel Hermann, Eric Goeller, Rusty Andrews, Sean Brinza, Sarah Catalina, Darcy Worden, Aarao Cornelio and many others who were my friends in turbulent times;

the secretaries and administrative assistants who greased the wheels of beauracracy and assisted me on numerous occasions with missed deadlines and missing forms;

and finally my parents and my family, immediate and extended, the people who at each step in my life stood by me even as I tested their patience and reserves of love sorely and to whom this thesis is dedicated.

%% this is the end of the front matter

%% now we include the actual chapters of the thesis
%% there are individual chapter files ch-intr.tex, ch-over.tex, ...
%% (NOTE: you do not need the ``.tex'' extention on the file name
%% in the include statement)
%% these chapters can be in a sub-directory, for example: 
%% \include{chapterdirectory/chaptername}

\include{chapters/intro}

\include{chapters/bcs_gravity}

\include{chapters/lambda_relaxation}

\include{chapters/voids_vs_lcdm}

\include{chapters/conclusion}

%% now we include the appendices
\appendices
%% omit this if there are no appendices

%% if there is only one appendix, 
%% say \singleappendix instead of \appendices
% \singleappendix

%% these are the actual commands to include the apendix files:

\include{app-bcs-gravity}

%\include{app-voids}

%\include{ap-more}


%% finally comes the bibliography and vita
%% the bibliography is generated automatically using BibTeX
%% Note: in order to get the (author year) citation style, this example 
%% includes a different *.bst style file than psuthesis.bst.  Sarah found 
%% this style file on: http://www.ee.oulu.fi/~harza/latex/  
%% This style includes the paper titles in the bibliography, so use it 
%% if you want:
%\bibliographystyle{/enter/path/to/ayphdthesis_mod}
%% However, according to the grad school thesis guide (c.2004), there is no 
%% special formating required for the bibliography, and to just follow 
%% the citation styles of your field, in that case the ``apj'' style is 
  %% prefectly OK, so that is the one that is going to be included in this
%% example file (use whichever style you prefer):
\bibliographystyle{jhep3}

%% the following is the path to you *.bib file 
%% (you do not need to enter the ``.bib'' extention)
\bibliography{../bib_library}
%% ADS can generate the entries in the bib file for you, just call up
%% the abstract, then near the bottom of the abstract page there is a
%% link to ``Bibtex entry for this abstract'' - just copy that into 
%% your bib file.  Here is an example bibtex entry:
%% @ARTICLE{citecode,
%%    author = {{Smith}, J. and {Jones}, M.},
%%     title = "{This Paper has some Really Cool Results}",
%%   journal = {\aj},
%%      year = 2002,
%%     month = sep,
%%    volume = 123,
%%     pages = {1-20},
%%    adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2002AJ....123.1S&amp;db_key=AST},
%%   adsnote = {Provided by the NASA Astrophysics Data System}
%% }
%% NOTE: ADS returns the AASTeX code for the journal name, you'll either 
%% have to change that by hand in each bib entry, or include a 
%% definition of the codes in your ``definitions'' file so LaTeX doesn't 
%% freak out.  Also, what I entered as ``citecode'' can be changed to 
%% whatever you want to use in the citations in the document, i.e., for
%% ``\citet{citecode}'' or ``\citep{citecode}''.


%% the thesis must end with a Curriculum Vitae (**one page or less**)
